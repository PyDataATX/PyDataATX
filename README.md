# PyDataATX

This is the digital home of the PyData Austin Texas meetup group. You can find our digital coordination center over at https://www.meetup.com/PyData-Austin/ . To learn more about PyData, the conference, meetup network and software tools, we recommend you starting at http://pydata.org. If you are in the right place feel free to ignore this message, keep calm and conda install.

In this repository, we hope to document our meetups and resources. For now we will keep it pretty old school with markdown and code, but perhaps some highly enthusiatic person will make it into more.
